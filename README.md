# battledome-scoreboard
Fork this repo to create a battledome scoreboard for your guild.

## getting started 
1. Fork this repo and name it `<GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io` - MUST be named this way in order for GitHub pages to work.
2. Configure your repo to be a GitHub pages site. [Full instructions here.](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)
   - Go to the settings tab of your repo.
   - Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
   - Choose `Deploy from a branch` as the source.
   - Select `main` branch and `/ (root)` folder.
3. After ~10 minutes, your scoreboard should be available to see at `<GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io/battledome.html` with one default player: superkathiee.
4. Customize the HTML page by... (_each update is optional_)
   - Setting `GITHUB_USERNAME` with your GitHub username
   - Setting `GUILD_NAME` with your guild name
   - Updating `#spuds tr:nth-child(even)` and `(odd)` background colors with custom colors
   - Replacing `background.png`, `banner.png`, and `icon.png` in the `images` folder of the repo with your own images
   - Updating background/font colors in `.yellow-box` and `#guild-totals`
   - Update the wording in the `yellow-box` class

### preparing the bd_fetcher script
1. You will need a GitHub personal access token (PAT) in order for the script to run. To create one:
   - Go to your GitHub settings
   - Click on "Developer settings" on the bottom of left sidebar
   - Select "Personal access tokens" > "Fine-grained tokens" > "Generate new token"
   - Give the token a name, description, and expiration
   - It is recommended to give the token access to "Only select repositories" > select your `<GITHUB_USERNAME>.github.io` repo, and add `Contents` permissions. That's the minimum that the script needs.
   - Confirm and generate. You will get a chance to copy this token **one time**. GitHub won't let you copy it again. **Keep it somewhere safe and never commit this token to your GitHub source code.**
2. Fill in the `// FIRST TIME USERS MUST FILL IN THESE DETAILS!!!!` block in the `bd_fetcher.js` script. You can (and should) commit these details to source code.
   - `GITHUB_USERNAME` and `MY_NAME`: self-explanatory
   - `AUTO_REFRESH_ON_FAILURE`: If set to **true**, when one of the pages fails, it will auto refresh the page until it succeeds. (On every test I've done, every page has eventually succeeded after a few seconds.) However, if you are nervous about your browser freezing OR about too many refreshes flagging your account, don't set this to true. If set to **false** (default) when it fails, you will see a "failed" box on the page, and you can either refresh the page or click "try again" to refresh it.
   - `PLAYERS`: comma-separated list of usernames to be included in the scoreboard
    ```
        const GITHUB_USERNAME = "";
        const MY_NAME = "Kat";
        const AUTO_REFRESH_ON_FAILURE = false;
        const PLAYERS = [
            "superkathiee"
        ];
    ```
3. Copy/paste the `bd_fetcher.js` script into a new TamperMonkey script. Then fill in the `SECRET_GITHUB_TOKEN` variable with the PAT you created in step 1. Again, do not commit to source code.

### running the script
1. To capture data for the first time, you will need to visit the battledome stats page of every user in the `PLAYERS` list. The URL for this page is `https://www.neopets.com/dome/record.phtml?username=USERNAME`
2. Upon visiting a stats page, the script will automatically capture data and push a new commit it to GitHub. These updates are committed to the `bd_scores.json` file in your repo. You can view the file in the source code to confirm it's coming through.
3. After you have visited all the players' stats pages, it takes ~3-5 minutes for the action that updates your pages site to complete running. (Each new commit to your repo usually cancels the previous run and makes a new one start, so sometimes it takes a bit longer for the data to reflect. To review the actions, navigate to `https://github.com/GITHUB_USERNAME/GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/actions`)
